# Archived Tasks

This directory contains documentation for completed tasks.

Archived tasks serve as:
- Reference for similar future work
- Knowledge base of past decisions
- Historical record of implementation approaches

When a task is complete, move its directory from `/dev/active/` to `/dev/archive/`.
