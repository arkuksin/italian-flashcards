# Active Tasks

This directory contains documentation for tasks currently in development.

Each task should have its own subdirectory with three files:
- `plan.md` - The approved implementation plan
- `context.md` - Key files, decisions, and context
- `tasks.md` - Checklist of work items

See `/dev/README.md` for usage instructions.
